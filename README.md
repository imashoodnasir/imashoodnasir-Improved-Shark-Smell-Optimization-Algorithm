<h1>Improved Shark Smell Optimization Algorithm</h1>
<p>a novel feature optimization algorithm, called improved Shark Smell Optimization (iSSO) is proposed to reduce the redundancy of extracted features. This proposed technique is inspired from the behavior of white sharks, how they find the best prey in the whole search space.</p>
<p>The proposed iSSO algorithm divides the Feature Vector (FV) into subparts, where a search is conducted to find local optimal features from each subpart of FV. Once local optimal features are selected, a global search is conducted to further optimize these features.</p>
<p>The proposed iSSO algorithm is employed on nine (9) selected CNN models. These CNN models are selected based on their top-1 and top-5 accuracy in ImageNet competition. To evaluate the model, two publicly available datasets UCF-Sports (D1) and Hollywood2 (D2) are selected.</p>
